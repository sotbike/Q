# Q

study title: A quantified comparison between robotic and open partial nephrectomy regarding the level of surgical precision through the formulation of a novel variable. A meta-analysis of comparative studies accompanied by sensitivity analysis.

computational procedure: Q variable formulation, meta-analysis & meta-regression analysis, sensitivity analysis

included items: individual study data, sensitivity analysis data, R code 

outcome: expected value & 95% confidence interval (CI95%) of the mean difference of Q when comparing robotic vs. open partial nephrectomy

meta-analysis: R code is included for the implementation of both fixed and random effects models; subgroups: studies published before & after 2015, studies with & without patient matching, single- / multicenter studies

meta-regression analysis: R code is included for the implementation of both fixed and random effects models; subgroups: studies published before & after 2015, studies with & without patient matching, single- / multicenter studies, moderators: year of publication, number of quality stars assigned based upon the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale

sensitivity analysis: change in the mean difference of Q between robotic and open partial nephrectomy for the various values obtained by the correlation coefficient (r) between the original variables (EBL & OT)
