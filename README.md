# Q

study title: A quantified comparison between robotic and open partial nephrectomy regarding the level of surgical precision through the formulation of a novel variable. A meta-analysis of comparative studies accompanied by sensitivity analysis

computational procedure: Q variable formulation, meta-analysis & meta-regression analysis, sensitivity analysis

included items: individual study data accompanied by computational code 

outcome: mean difference of the Q variable when comparing robotic vs. open partial nephrectomy

meta-analysis: R code is included for the implementation of fixed and random effects models; subgroups: studies published before & after 2015, studies with & without     patient matching, single- / multicenter studies

meta-regression analysis: R code is included for the implementation of fixed and random effects models; subgroups: studies published before & after 2015, studies with & without patient matching, single- / multicenter studies, moderators: year of publication, number of quality stars from the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale

instructions for the replication of results: fisrtly place the data file on desktop, then configure the path to the file through the "read.csv" command, finally run the code
